# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to build a binary classification model predicting whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning (handling invalid zero entries)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Predictions saved as CSV for later use

## 📁 Files
- `diabetes-prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `logistic_regression_predictions.csv`: Model output 
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

📊 Results

- Accuracy: ~75.3%
- Clean, readable notebook with end-to-end analysis and predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook (from Kaggle)
