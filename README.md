# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to build a binary classification model predicting whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning (handling invalid zero entries)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Predictions saved as CSV for later use

## 📁 Files
- `diabetes-prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `logistic_regression_predictions.csv`: Model output 
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
